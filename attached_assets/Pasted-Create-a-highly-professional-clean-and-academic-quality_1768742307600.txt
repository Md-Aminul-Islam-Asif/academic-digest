Create a highly professional, clean, and academic-quality user interface
for a University Library Management System using React.

This project is for a university Web Programming Lab evaluation, so the design
must prioritize clarity, structure, usability, and documentation readiness.

PROJECT PURPOSE:
A university-focused Library Management System for managing books, students,
fees, discounts, and feedback with a simple but professional interface.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Professional academic look
- Minimalist and structured layout
- Neutral color palette (white, gray, soft blue)

- No flashy animations
- Smooth hover and focus states only
- Screenshot-ready for academic PDF submission
